P1 and P2 are called 'handles' and don't necessarily lie on the curve itself, but they control its shape and direction",

      title: "Why are they useful?",
      content:
        "Flexibility: You can create a wide variety of shapes by adjusting the position of the control points. Scalability: BÃ©zier curves can be resized infinitely without losing quality. Smoothness: The curves offer smooth transitions, making them ideal for animation and font design. Efficiency: They can be represented with just four numbers (coordinates of the points), making them efficient for storage and transmission.",

Web design: Controlling shapes and transitions in user interfaces (e.g., CSS animations). Font design: Shaping and smoothing individual characters and font outlines.",
